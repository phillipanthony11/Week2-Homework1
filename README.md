# Week 1 Homework 2 Portfolio

## Despription

I attempted to make a porfolio that resembled and acted like the example Joe gave us. At the beginning I tried to avoid div elements but by the end I was just trying to get it done. I think there is probably lots of extra CSS but at the end I was too scared to try and clean anything up because whenever I messed with one thing everything seemed to go wrong.
